    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The goal of the game is too shoot the fruit by clicking them, gaining points for each fruit you shoot.
        <br>
       Forever loops were used to constantly check if the conditions/variables were fulfilled (level number, lives left, time left)
        <br>
        and change the game in correspondence (change game speed, end game).
        <br>
       Increments were used to add points when the fruit was clicked, and too remove points whenever the fruit was not clicked in 
        <br>
       time, as well as a time variable that would count down.
        <br>
       The barebones and simple nature of the game did not provide any real difficulties or intuitive oppurtunities.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>- The story is about your path to becoming a knight.
        <br>
        - The code is pretty much all basic python that we have learned. No new python concepts were necessary.
        <br>
        - Once again, because of the basic nature of the code, no issues came up.
        <br>
        - I feel that if I had started earlier I would have been able to hit all the plot points that I had laid out beforehand. The 
        <br>
        story was only half complete by the due date, so I had to void a complete other branch of the story, instead replacing it 
        <br>
        with a cheap cop out.
        <br>
        - I don't really remember the details of the other stories I read sry.
        <br>
        - If I could do this again, I would, as I said, start earlier so I could expand the plot to its fullest.
