    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The goal of the game is too shoot the fruit by clicking them, gaining points for each fruit you shoot.
        <br>
       Forever loops were used to constantly check if the conditions/variables were fulfilled (level number, lives left, time left) and change the game in correspondence (change game speed, end game).
        <br>
       Increments were used to add points when the fruit was clicked, and too remove points whenever the fruit was not clicked in time, as well as a time variable that would count down.
        <br>
       The barebones and simple nature of the game did not provide any real difficulties or intuitive oppurtunities.
